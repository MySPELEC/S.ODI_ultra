## SYSTEM ON-BOARD DEVELOPMENT INTERFACE  ultra v1.0
  You can construct your intelligent hardware system with very low to no effort using our development board S.ODI ultra developed by SPELEC.

The S.ODI (System onboard development interface) is a Development board that has integrated sensors regarding Humidity, Temperature, flame, LDR and infrared it also has RGB(LED light) which works as an indicator. S.ODI also comes with onboard WI-FI, Bluetooth, BLE which are used to connect with various devices. 
 
With the collection of onboard hardware components and the open-source firmware that we supply one can quickly learn how to get hardware connected online, and how to use Web API and/or smartphones to interact with it.
### S.ODI is a system on board that integrates the following features: 
#### Wi-Fi (2.4 GHz band)
#### Bluetooth 4.2 
#### Bluetooth Low Energy 
#### Infrared comm 
#### Dual high-performance cores
#### Ultra-Low Power co-processor 
#### Several peripherals 
#### Upto 10 Sensors Onboard

  Powered by 40 nm technology, S.ODI provides a robust, highly integrated platform, which helps meet the continuous demands for efficient power usage, compact design, security, high performance, and reliability. 
 SPELEC provides necessary hardware and software resources to help application developers realize their ideas using the S.ODI series hardware. The software development framework by SPELEC is for the development of Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications with WiFi, Bluetooth, power management and several other system features
